# Project Goal:
Text preparation stands as a crucial requirement before machine learning can utilize it effectively. Most documents contain unnecessary formatting along with symbols which make interpretations difficult for models. The first step involves text cleaning along with tokenization of words. Stop words, such as "the" and "is," are eliminated. For consistency, we also make all text lowercase. We use weighted words and word embeddings as techniques to convert text into useful features.

# Tools, Software and Libraries Used:

1. Jupyter Notebook
2. Numpy
3. Pandas
4. Seaborn
5. Matplotlib
6. Scikit-learn
7. Transformers
8. sklearn.metrics
9. Torch
10. Glove

We have implemented all the algorithms and also added our own to compare the accuracy and  to figure out which algorithms works best for the text classification on the dataset we have chosen.
