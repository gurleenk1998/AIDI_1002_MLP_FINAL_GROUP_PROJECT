# Project Goal:
Text preparation stands as a crucial requirement before machine learning can utilize it effectively. Most documents contain unnecessary formatting along with symbols which make interpretations difficult for models. The first step involves text cleaning along with tokenization of words. Stop words, such as "the" and "is," are eliminated. For consistency, we also make all text lowercase. We use weighted words and word embeddings as techniques to convert text into useful features.
